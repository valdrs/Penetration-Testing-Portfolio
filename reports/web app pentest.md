# Web Application Penetration Test Report

**Target:** Custom Web Application (Lab Environment)  
**Assessment Type:** Black-Box Web Application Security Test  
**Tester:** Vishnu K Anand  
**Date:** November 2025  

---

## 1. Scope
The assessment targeted a web application providing user authentication and account management functionality.  
Testing focused on authorization controls, input validation, and session handling.

**Out of scope:** Denial-of-service and brute-force attacks.

---

## 2. Methodology
Testing was performed using a manual, attack-path–driven approach aligned with the **OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG)**:

- Application mapping and endpoint discovery  
- Authentication and authorization testing  
- Manual request manipulation using Burp Suite  
- Vulnerability validation and impact analysis  

---

## 3. Findings Summary

| Vulnerability | Severity |
|--------------|----------|
| Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) | High |
| SQL Injection (Authentication Bypass) | High |
| Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) | Medium |

---

## 4. Detailed Findings

### 4.1 Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

**Severity:** High  
**OWASP Category:** A01 – Broken Access Control  

#### Description
The application relied on client-supplied object identifiers to control access to user-specific resources.  
Server-side authorization checks were not consistently enforced.

#### Evidence
- Authenticated as a low-privileged user  
- Intercepted a request containing a user identifier  
- Modified the identifier value  
- Successfully accessed another user’s account data  

#### Impact
- Unauthorized access to sensitive user information  
- Potential account takeover  
- Data confidentiality violations  

#### Remediation
- Enforce server-side authorization checks  
- Use indirect object references (UUIDs)  
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)  

---

### 4.2 SQL Injection (Authentication Bypass)

**Severity:** High  
**OWASP Category:** A03 – Injection  

#### Description
User input within the authentication mechanism was not properly sanitized, allowing crafted SQL payloads to alter backend queries.

#### Impact
- Authentication bypass  
- Unauthorized access to protected functionality  
- Potential full database compromise  

#### Remediation
- Use parameterized queries / prepared statements  
- Implement strict input validation  
- Apply least-privilege access to database accounts  

---

### 4.3 Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Severity:** Medium  
**OWASP Category:** A03 – Injection  

#### Description
Unsanitized user input was reflected in server responses, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the victim’s browser.

#### Impact
- Session hijacking  
- Credential theft  
- Client-side manipulation  

#### Remediation
- Context-aware output encoding  
- Input validation and sanitization  
- Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP)  

---

## 5. Tools Used
- Burp Suite (Proxy, Repeater)  
- Manual payload testing  
- Kali Linux  

---

## 6. Risk Summary
The application contained multiple high-risk vulnerabilities that could be chained to compromise user accounts.  
The absence of robust server-side authorization and input validation significantly increased the application’s attack surface.

---

## 7. Conclusion
This assessment identified common but critical web application security weaknesses frequently observed during real-world penetration tests.  
Proper enforcement of access control mechanisms and secure coding practices would significantly reduce overall risk exposure.
