This repository contains a curated set of penetration testing reports created in controlled lab environments.
The focus is on **methodology, impact, and remediation**, not walkthroughs or CTF-style solutions.

## What This Demonstrates
- Black-box web, Linux, and Windows penetration testing
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerability identification and exploitation
- Privilege escalation and attack chaining
- Professional reporting and remediation guidance

## Report Index
- Web Application Penetration Test (OWASP Top 10)
- WordPress to Linux Root Compromise
- Windows SMB Exploitation (MS17-010)
- File Upload Bypass & Linux Privilege Escalation

## Methodology
All assessments follow a structured approach:
Reconnaissance → Enumeration → Exploitation → Post-Exploitation → Reporting
