# Penetration Testing Methodology

My testing approach aligns with industry standards such as OWASP WSTG and common consultancy workflows.

## Phases
1. Reconnaissance & Enumeration
2. Attack Surface Analysis
3. Manual Exploitation
4. Privilege Escalation
5. Impact Assessment
6. Remediation Guidance

## Principles
- Manual-first testing
- Exploit validation before reporting
- Business impact over tool output
- Clear remediation over academic theory
